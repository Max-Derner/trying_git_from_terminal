# trying git from terminal
some text
^^I'm leaving that there because I aslo did it from terminal.

Welcome, I have been messing around trying to figure out how do work git from the terminal because it's good for you, makes you grow up big and strong.
Feel free to have a look around, I try to keep myself interested.
I'm sure I'll be back much later to figure out the stuff I'm about to learn.
